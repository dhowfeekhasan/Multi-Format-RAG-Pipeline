# Multi-Format-RAG-Pipeline
Developed a local RAG pipeline to process PDF, Word, Excel, PPT, and image files. Extracted and indexed text, tables, and visuals using sentence-transformer embeddings. Enabled natural language querying with relevant content retrieval. Used a local LLaMA 2 model for generating accurate, context-aware answers.
